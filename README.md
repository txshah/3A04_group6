# Overall Project Notes

You and your development team have been contracted to specify, design, and implement a system modeling application that allows a user to input 
specific characteristics that your application will use to identify what the object or phenomenon is.
The specifics of what kind of objects or phenomenons you identify is up to your team, but must first be approved by the Teaching Assistants.

1. The application must implement at least three experts which are consulted for the identification.
2. Each expert must be separate from another and easily swappable.
3. If the expertise of the expert allows it, they must answer.
4. There must be a centralized “Forum” which the experts report their answer.
5. If various conflicting answers are reported, the “Forum” must resolve the conflict.
6. The “Forum” must report an answer.
7. All recorded answers must be stored, along with a report of if the item was correctly identified by the user
