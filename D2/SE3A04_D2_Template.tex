\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This document provides a high-level overview of the Gaim wildlife identification system architecture, including design considerations for the system and its subsystems. The document details architectural choices, subsystem interactions, and class-level responsibilities within the system.\newline

\noindent{The intended audience for this document includes internal stakeholders such as software developers, system architects, project managers, domain experts in wildlife identification, and potential investors interested in the technological aspects of Gaim. It is recommended that Deliverable 1 be reviewed prior to reading this document for a foundational understanding of the system requirements.}
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
The system utilizes a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture combined with Repository and Blackboard architectural styles to efficiently process data from various knowledge sources and provide accurate species identification.\newline

\noindent{The system is designed to facilitate interactions between different subsystems with some subsystems incorporating blackboard architecture, while other incorporate repository architectural style.}

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
The Gaim app utilizes an Interaction-Oriented Software Architecture, specifically Model View Controller, to house all the subsystems. The view represents the interface for user interaction and the controller and model represent the three major subsystems and their respective database. The subsystems follow Data-Centric Architecture styles with classification subsystems using Blackboard. The agents are the independent experts (knowledge sources) with whom the user can interact. Synchronously, the blackboard, the active data store component, will take this information in, dividing the solution space, providing a non-deterministic answer and controlling the logic of the application. \\

\begin{table}[h]
Within our system, the components are defined as the following:  
    \centering
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
    \begin{tabular}{| m{5cm} | m{6cm} | m{4cm} |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Subsystem} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Architectural Style} \\
        \hline
        Classification Management & Start a search, submit an image, submit text, fill a survey & Blackboard \\
        \hline
        Generate a Report & View result, generate report, view score, save & Repository \\
        \hline
        Account Management & Create an account and log in to an account & Repository \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    % \caption{Subsystems and Their Architectural Styles}
    % \label{tab:subsystems}
\end{table}

System relationships are defined in section 3.2 of this document. 
\\

Three databases are present on the model level of this architecture. An account database for account details, a classification database with background information regarding species identification (encompassing both description and image sources), and a report generation database to track user-saved searches. 
\\

Our system architecture incorporates the Repository and Blackboard architecture styles. The blackboard style is chosen because it supports multiple independent knowledge sources that can be independently called and allows for a logical data store to present a final output. This is beneficial as our app involves multiple experts/sources of input that the user can utilize, either exclusively or in tandem, to classify a species. Due to this functionality, Blackboard architecture is ideal for classification management as we can narrow down the solution space based on agents and manage them based on the status of the data store. Additionally, in terms of further expansion, it will become very easy to incorporate additional experts/knowledge sources, giving the user more potential use cases for the application.
\\

Another one of the architectures we chose is the Repository Architecture Style as it supports the direct fetching of deterministic outputs from agent requests. This architectural style supports large complex information systems where different components need to access various areas of information. This is the type of access the account management subsystem and report generation system will require, as many users should be able to use the application at the same time and access their specific reports and data. Additionally, this style allows the account management system to easily access stored user information, making it easy for agents to create new accounts and pull credentials for verification. This style also supports data integrity, for backups and restores, which is ideal for account security. Furthermore, for the generated report subsystem, the repository style allows direct access to information from our report generation database and enables the subsystem to display the requested report based on user (agent) input. This architectural style is ideal for expanding new applications, making it easy for us to manage user data, ensure data integrity, and potentially expand the user base.
\\

The overall architecture style chosen for the interaction between these subsystems is the Model View Controller. This architecture style is used because it supports the connection between the user view (presentation) and the data model (backend component) through a controller component that manages input situations and communicates with the appropriate subsystem/database functionality. We can also support frequent data changes, which is essential in the hunting sector which has a changing landscape based on seasonality and new regulations. Further, it is easy to update current functionalities and logic in one component without changing the entire system. This can be beneficial for a newer product because of frequent updates in the user interface or changes to classification logic.
