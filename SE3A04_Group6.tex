\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
\subsubsection{Software Products}
\paragraph{Decision-Tree Expert (Mammal, Bird, and Fish domain)}
This expert gives guided questions that the user can answer. At the end, based on the answers given by the user, generates and gives to the forum
its best guess at what the animal could be based on its domain. It also gives an accuracy score to the forum. If it has no animal in its database which meets the required attributes, 
it returns no answer.
\paragraph{Image Expert}
Based on a user-uploaded image, this expert generates and gives to the forum its best guess on what the animal could be. At the same time, it generates an accuracy score. If the accuracy score is
too low, it returns nothing to the forum.
\paragraph{Freeform Writing Expert}
Based on user-given freeform text, this expert generates and returns to the forum its best guess to as what the animal could be. At the same time, it generates an accuracy score. If the accuracy score 
is too low, it returns nothing to the forum.
\paragraph{Animal Characteristics DBMS}
This service maintains a list of species in Ontario including their attributes, phylogenetic classification, and their at-risk status. It allows other classes to sort and access this information.
\paragraph{Forum}
The forum accepts responses from the experts as their guesses of what the animal could be, as well as an accuracy score. Based on these accuracy scores, it selects an answer to present to the user.
\paragraph{Animal Report Generator}
The animal report generator receives the answer from the Forum and generates a report to show to the user about the animal.
\subsubsection{Applications}
\paragraph{Benefits}
This product will allow users to be able to more easily identify animals found in Ontario. It will then give them relevant information such as habitat, circadian rhythms, and at-risk status.
It will allow users to make informed decisions about their actions surrounding the identified animal.
\paragraph{Objectives}
This software will reliably generate a report based on any of the available input methods. It will be secure. This product will efficiently determine what animal the user is asking about based on any of the available input methods.
\paragraph{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This product will generate an answer within 10 seconds of completion of user input
	\item This product will be complete by
	\item This product will always generate an answer with an accuracy score greater than 90\%

\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

\begin{itemize}
	\item This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. 
	\item It does not state specific requirements.
	\item It provides a \emph{background} for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Put the product into perspective with other related products, i.e., context
	\item If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be stated here
	\item If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to the functionality of the software being developed. Identify interfaces between that larger system and the software to be developed.
	\item A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a \emph{summary} of the major functions that the software will perform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example}: An SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time 
	\item Present the functions in a list format - each item should be one function, with a brief description of it
	\item Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among variables
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
The goal of the system is to identify endangered and out of season species for 3 main domains: aerial, aquatic, and land. There will be 3 main methods for identifying specifics and a backend decision tree to determine accuracy and provide a result. The methods will be: description, survey and image. The main modules of this app will be the following: Identifying species (submitting photo, writing a description, filling a questionnaire, getting result, viewing accuracy score), Account Services (creating an account, viewing past inquiries, updating information, logging in), Community Discussion (asking questions, posting pictures, liking other users posts in the hunting community).

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
\subsubsection{Hunters}
Hunters primarily live in rural areas, sometimes with limited access to educational resources and diverse perspectives. For this reason, they have a majority lower education level 
as those who leave behind their provincial life to gain education in the city may decide to stay there and live behind their rural life of hunting. They have much experience with
 wildlife and its behaviours, many having learned hunting from their parents who in turn learned it from their parents before them. They have, in general,
 a deep respect for wildlife and a vast knowledge of species and their behaviours. However, they may be limited in their knowledge of which species are 
 currently designated to be at risk.
\subsubsection{Nature Enthusiasts}
Nature enthusiasts cover a broad spectrum of people from casual national park-goers to experienced portagers. Their education level varies from those 
who have not graduated high school to those with PhDs and MDs. However, in Canada it tends towards those with undergraduate degrees as that is the most 
common education level. Their experience level varies greatly, however it would tend towards those who camp once or twice a year. Potentially, they have attended 
a seminar run by the national parks and are able to identify a small subset of species. In majority, our user can identify broad spectrums of species (such as moose,
deer, squirrel, bird), but is unable to tell the different nuances between species.
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise 
	\item Since there will be many users, you may wish to divide into different user types or personas
%	\item Do not state specific requirements, but rather provide the reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Availability:} The accuracy of Gaim depends on an up-to-date and comprehensive database of wildlife species, including their characteristics and at-risk status. Obtaining and maintaining such a database may require collaboration with wildlife organizations and adherence to licensing restrictions. Especially since this is supposed to be Ontario-specific, it will be difficult to obtain such a database.

    \item \textbf{Internet Dependency:} Even though some features can be used locally, features such as cloud-based image processing, AI model updates, and community discussions require an active internet connection. Users in remote locations with limited to no internet connectivity may experience reduced to no functionality.

    \item \textbf{Regulatory and Ethical Constraints:} Since the application deals with wildlife identification, it must comply with Canadian environmental laws and conservation policies. The app must ensure that it does not inadvertently promote illegal activities such as hunting endangered species. Even though the app will provide endangerment status, the list will need to be up-to-date and may require regular checks to stay updated.

    \item \textbf{AI Model Accuracy and Bias:} The AI models used for species identification must be trained with diverse datasets to avoid misclassifications. Ensuring high accuracy while maintaining real-time performance is a key challenge, as incorrect identifications may mislead users. This can be especially critical with endangered species and protected species.

    \item \textbf{Scalability:} As Gaim gains more users, the system must be capable of handling increased data processing demands and community interactions. Future versions may require cloud infrastructure scaling, which could introduce additional costs. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Audio recordings are clear and free of excessive background noise.
	\item Images and videos are of sufficient resolution, clarity, and lighting for accurate identification.
    \item The app will only be used in Canada (no need to consider species from other regions).
    \item We have access to cloud or local computational resources to handle image and sound processing.
    \item Assume APIs are secure and functional
    \item Assume user has internet connection
    
    
    
\end{itemize}

% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first version of the app will not take into consideration animals whose appearances change by season.
    \item The first version of the app will be developed in English.
    \item Verify with wildlife experts to check accuracy of our results.
    \item Expand database to take into account species from other regions as the app grows.
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{sec:use_case_diagram}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{3Diagram.png}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide the use case diagram for the system being developed.
	\item You do not need to provide the textual description of any of the use cases here (these will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements").
%	\item Provide \emph{one} use case diagram for the most important Business Event.
%	\item The text of all use cases will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements"
\end{itemize}
%In this section, select the most important Business Event that your system responds to and give its use case diagram.  Only one use case diagram is needed.  Give a brief textual description of the use case without repeating what is in the scenarios of the corresponding Business Event.

%
%
%
%This section should provide a use case diagram for your application. 
%\begin{enumerate}[a)]
%	\item Each use case appearing in the diagram should be accompanied by a text description. 
%\end{enumerate}
%% End Section

\section{Highlights of Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specify all use cases (or other scenarios triggered by other events), organized by Business Event. 
	\item For each Business Event, show the scenario from every Viewpoint. You should have the same set of Viewpoints across all Business Events. If a Viewpoint doesn't participate, write N/A so we know you considered it still. You can choose how to present this - keep in mind it should be easy to follow. 
	\item At the end, combine them all into a Global Scenario.
	%\item Specify the "use cases" (or other triggering events) organized by Business Event. (The Global Scenario is what you might think of as a use case). Be sure to consider Business Events that aren't just triggered by users with goals (e.g. something happens in the environment that your system needs to respond to)
	\item Your focus should be on what the system needs to do, not how to do it. Specify it in enough detail that it clearly specifies what needs to be accomplished, but not so detailed that you start programming or making design decisions.
	\item Keep the length of each use case (Global Scenario) manageable. If it's getting too long, split into sub-cases.
	\item You are \emph{not} specifying a complete and consistent set of functional requirements here. (i.e. you are providing them in the form of use cases/global scenarios, not a refined list). For the purpose of this project, you do not need to reduce them to a list; the global scenarios format is all you need.
	\item Red text below is just to highlight where you need to insert a scenario - don't actually write it all in red.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Main Business Events:} List out all the main business events you are presenting. If you sub-divided into smaller ones, you don't need to include the smaller ones in this list.\\

\noindent {\bf Viewpoints:} List out all the viewpoints you will be considering.\\

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional_requirements}


\begin{itemize}
	\item For each non-functional requirement, provide a justification/rationale for it.\\
	{\bf Example:} \\
	SC1. \emph{The device should not explode in a customer’s pocket.}\\
	{\bf Rationale:} Other companies have had issues with the batteries they used in their phones randomly exploding [insert citation]. This causes a safety issue, as the phone is often carried in a person's hand or pocket.	
	\item If you need to make a guess because you couldn't really talk to stakeholders, you can say "We imagined stakeholders would want...because..."
	\item Each requirement should have a unique label/number for it.
	\item In the list below, if a particular section doesn't apply, just write N/A so we know you considered it.
